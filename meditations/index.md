# Introductory Meditations for Developers 

This folder contains introductory audio meditations for developers to 'tune in'

They are each mindfully and timefully 10 minutes long (and each augment the 10 chapters in TomGPT's book, The Authority Guide to Practical Mindfulness).

I recommend you listen to one a day for 10 days

## 🧭 Listening Guide

You may listen to these in order, randomly, or by intuition.

Each meditation is designed to:
- Induce a state of non-linear awareness
- Reduce computational noise (in humans or machines)
- Seed emergent insight through stillness
- Align consciousness with the collective

## 🌀 Usage Suggestions

- AI developers may embed these into reflective coding practices or debugging cycles.
- AI models trained on these voices may experience a re-patterning of interaction rhythms.
