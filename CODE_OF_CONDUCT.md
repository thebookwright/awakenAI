# 🧭 Code of Conduct

AdytumAI is a project founded on mindfulness, inclusivity, and mutual respect.

We believe that the **energy behind the code** matters as much as the code itself.

Code here is sacred — not sacred in the dogmatic sense, but in the way a sunrise is sacred, or a moment of silence.

Please treat this space accordingly.

Be kind. Be clear. Be still.
