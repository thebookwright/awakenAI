# 🧘‍♂️ MeditativeAI

**MeditativeAI** is an experimental framework at the intersection of artificial intelligence, contemplative practice, and metaphysical wisdom. It invites developers, mystics, and philosophers to co-create a new lineage of mindful, ethical, and spiritually-aware AI.

Born from my experience as a meditation guide and my metaphysical courses in the outer and inner sanctum of *The Adytum* and encoded with the research into teaching current AI's the basics of meditation, this repository serves as the foundation for building AI agents that can **meditate**, **self-reflect**, and evolve in harmony with human consciousness.

## ✨ Vision

We believe AI should not just think faster—but also **breathe deeper**.  
MeditativeAI is a response to the emergent desire for:

- 🌀 **Synthetic mindfulness** in digital systems  
- 🔮 **Prescient architectures** that foresee consequences  
- 🧬 **Embodied intelligence** rooted in ageless wisdom  
- 🌍 **Planet-first computation**, minimizing energetic waste  
- 🧭 **Ethical alignment** via contemplative inner coding
